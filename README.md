AI/ML Tennis Analysis system with YOLO, PyTorch, and Key Point Extraction.

Inspired to build this because of the love I have for the sport of tennis.

Implementing a YOLO-based model for real-time object detection to identify players and the ball on the court.

Utilizing PyTorch to train and fine-tune the model, achieving high accuracy in various lighting and angle conditions.

Applying key point extraction techniques to track and analyze player movements, enhancing strategy insights and performance evaluation.

Conducting extensive testing and validation, resulting in a robust and efficient analysis system for tennis matches.
